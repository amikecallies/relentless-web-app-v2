			<h3>"Even though he is one of the best trainers I know, his best quality is his ability to make every client he 
				works with feel comfortable."
			</h3>
			<br>
			<p>
				I’ve trained with Keith for over 3 years, and I’ve seen results from the beginning. 
				Keith does a great job of pushing you to the max, but he understands that he can only push you as far as you want. 
				His passion is something that stands out and I’ve seen him improve in his art from the time I met him. 
				He is a student of the game and is constantly looking to improve and learn so that he can pass 
				those teachings to his clients. I’ve witnessed first hand his growth from a trainer who would occasionally 
				do yoga and flexibility/stability workouts to becoming a yoga instructor who has mastered an array of 
				workouts depending on what his clients goals are. As hardworking and passionate as he is about his art 
				he is just as humble and down to earth as a person. He has a vast amount of knowledge through 
				all his years of studying and is eager to teach his clients so that they can succeed. Even though 
				he is one of the best trainers I know, his best quality is his ability to make every client he works with feel comfortable.

			<p>His enthusiasm, energy, and encouragement are contagious. His desire to see each of his clients succeed, is the 
				relentless pursuit, that drives him to a level of excellence in personal training that I have never experienced before.

			<p>For me, Keith is more than a trainer, he’s more of a life coach and a true friend his positivity and 
				dedication to excellence is contagious.in training with him I’ve lost a total of 72lbs...in a little more 
				than a year and I’m still at it. All in All, he’s had such an amazing impact on me and I know he’s got big plans coming!

			<p>I have never done any handstand or headstand in my life until I hired this young guy-Keith. 
				Yes! He has the most enthusiastic environment and challenging way to train, 
				he does not discriminate based on age. I’m 50 + and he has made me so strong and hungry to 
				continue to grow my infinite fitness journey. 
				If you are serious about changing your mediocre or average life, and want to become fit, hire this young guy and stick with him.

			<p>“If you’re looking for a trainer to help change your life, look no further. Keith is your man. With his help, you’ll 
				be able to do things you never imagined and you’ll have fun doing it. Don’t be misled though, he can guide you 
				through your journey, but he can’t do the work for you. That’s up to you.” I was about to turn 52. I was overweight, 
				lazy, and lacking in self confidence. All of which I never experienced before.A knee replacement, which was supposed to to 
				give me back the life I loved struck me down like a bug hitting a windshield at 80 mph. I knew I needed help but I was 
				too ashamed to ask. Then in May of 2018, I attended my brothers in law’s birthday and I met Keith. I knew he was a trainer 
				because both my brother and brother in law worked out with him. I couldn’t believe how fit he was and even more so how 
				kind he was. We spoke for a while and exercise was never brought up. 2 months passed and something clicked. I 
				recognized that I was a bystander in this life and not a participant. I made the dreadful call to Keith and asked for help. 
				I showed up for my appointment and he showed me around the gym and explained how he could help me, if I was willing to work. 
				The next day I had my first session and I was scared. I’d never had a trainer before. I’d only done group exercise, 
				so there was no way I could hide my shortcomings. It was difficult, but not so hard that I didn’t want to come back and 
				I was sore. I couldn’t do a sit up, much less a push up and my Turkish get up was more like a Turkey slice! I don’t 
				know how but he knows what I can do before I do and while he always pushes me to “level up,” he never pushes me beyond 
				my abilities and recognizes the limitations of my knee. He likes to say. “It’s time to get comfortable being uncomfortable” 
				and I know what that means. If things stay the same, nothing will ever change. The best thing about training with Keith is 
				that we have fun. Since day one, there hasn’t been a session that we don’t bust up laughing. Why show up if you’re not 
				enjoying what you’re doing? Fast forward a year and I can do all the aforementioned and then some! I’m almost 40 lbs. 
				Lighter and I’m living life again. I was only able to do this because I had Keith by my side. His guidance, motivation, 
				and knowledge, his passion and his kindness has helped me cross the bridge of self doubt. One of his favorite authors is 
				Frederick Douglass, and his favorite quote is, “Without struggle there can be no progress. I know what this quote means 
				because I lived it and so can you.

			<p>When I first met Keith I was in a very rough part of my life. I was depressed and horribly out of shape. 
				Keith was very warm and welcoming. He asked me what I wanted from our sessions and I said I just want 
				to feel better. He eased me into his functional strength training program and made it enjoyable so I 
				wanted to come back. I’ve been with Keith for almost 2 years and in those two years I have grown 
				significantly, both physically and mentally. I am the strongest I’ve ever been and my mental health 
				has improved dramatically. I can now do things physically that were impossible 2 years ago thanks to Keith. 
				I move better, my body doesn’t hurt or ache like it use to. I don’t know where I would be if it wasn’t 
				for his guidance and encouragement. I can not say enough good things about Keith. He is an expert in his field. 
				I’m lucky to train with him and call him my friend.

			<p>Keith is the person in my life I never thought I needed. 
				Playing college tennis, I knew how to train and the intensity it takes. But having graduated I 
				lacked the motivation and what was good and bad for my body type. 
				As soon as we started, he adapted the sessions to what I needed to work on 
				and he has made me fall in love with working out. What’s even better, is the sessions are fun. 
				I push myself whilst laughing so hard my belly hurts. His knowledge of the body and his passion 
				for helping people achieve their goals shines. He’s a goofball, but he’s the most loyal and 
				hardworking goofball I know and this is why I look forward to the sessions every week:)

			<p>What makes Keith stand out from other trainers is not just his ability to create individualized programs for 
				his clients, but the vast knowledge he is able to convey about the body and what it needs for optimal 
				performance and injury prevention.

			<p>You can find a personal trainer, or you can find Keith. If you want to be 
				successful at anything, whether it’s in a relationship, business, family, 
				nutrition or fitness, what you need is consistency and accountability. 
				Keith undoubtedly brings that every session. 
				Not just a trainer but as a good friend.
